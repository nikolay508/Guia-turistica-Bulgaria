# Bulgaria: A Hidden Gem of Europe

## Overview

Created for a Spanish class, the content is entirely in Spanish, serving both an academic purpose and a broader educational goal: to introduce more people to the wonders of this magnificent country.

	•	Improve our Spanish writing and research skills

	•	Encourage cultural appreciation and curiosity
