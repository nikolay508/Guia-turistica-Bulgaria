# 🇧🇬 Bulgaria: A Hidden Gem of Europe

## 🖼️ Overview 
This project is dedicated to showcase Bulgaria, a country often overlooked but rich in history, culture, and beauty. Created for a Spanish class, the content is entirely in Spanish, serving both an academic purpose and a broader educational goal: to introduce more people to the wonders of this magnificent country.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as part of a Spanish language class, but it’s designed to go beyond a school assignment. It’s meant to:<br><br/>
	•	Improve our Spanish writing and research skills<br/>
	•	Educate others about Bulgaria’s unique identity<br/>
	•	Encourage cultural appreciation and curiosity
